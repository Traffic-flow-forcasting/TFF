## Implementation Tips

### üì¶ Data Pipeline

- Create efficient data loaders that handle the large datasets
- Implement sliding window approaches for sequence generation
- Use mini-batch processing for memory efficiency

### üß† Model Architecture

- Start with implementing each component separately
- For the **ARIMA-LSTM** component:
  - First predict with ARIMA
  - Then feed residuals to LSTM
- Use **PyTorch Geometric** or **DGL** for GNN implementation
- Use attention mechanisms for model fusion

### üìà Evaluation

- Implement multi-step prediction (15‚Äì60 minutes)
- Compare performance at different forecasting horizons
- Document both accuracy metrics and computational efficiency

### üìê Theoretical Framework

- Validate your error bound theory with empirical results
- Test the **orthogonality assumption** between ARIMA and LSTM errors
- Analyze when **Œ± + Œ≤ < 1** holds in practice

### üïµÔ∏è Interpretability

- Visualize attention weights to understand model focus
- Use **SHAP** analysis to identify feature importance
- Create spatiotemporal heatmaps for prediction visualization

### üîÅ Reproducibility

- Use fixed random seeds
- Create configuration files for all experiments
- Document environment requirements
