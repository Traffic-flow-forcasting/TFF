# TFF: Hybrid Spatiotemporal Graph Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting

A **comprehensive research implementation** combining traditional statistical methods with modern deep learning for traffic flow prediction. This project implements ensemble methods that combine ARIMA, LSTM, and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to achieve superior forecasting accuracy while providing theoretical error bounds and cross-city transfer learning capabilities[1][2][3].

## Project Overview

The TFF (Traffic Flow Forecasting) system addresses the critical challenge of urban traffic prediction by leveraging the complementary strengths of three distinct modeling approaches. The project demonstrates that ensemble learning consistently improves predictive performance across evaluation metrics, with adaptive weighting methods achieving optimal results by dynamically combining model predictions based on input features[1].

**Core Innovation:**
- **Hybrid architecture** combining linear (ARIMA), nonlinear temporal (LSTM), and spatial (GNN) dependencies
- **Theoretical framework** with proven error bounds: `E[||y-ŷ||²] ≤ αE[||y_ARIMA-y||²] + βE[||y_LSTM-y||²]` where α + β < 1 under orthogonality conditions[2]
- **Cross-city transfer learning** using MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy) distance for domain adaptation[2]
- **Multi-step prediction** capabilities for 15-60 minute forecasting horizons[2]

## Methodology & Architecture

### Individual Model Components

**ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
The classical time series component captures linear trends and seasonality using the formulation[1]:
```
(1 - Σφᵢ Lⁱ)(1-L)ᵈ Xₜ = (1 + Σθᵢ Lⁱ)εₜ
```
- Parameters: p=3 (autoregressive), d=1 (differencing), q=2 (moving average)
- Effectively models linear temporal patterns and seasonal components
- Limitation: Struggles with complex nonlinear behaviors common in traffic data

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**  
Captures nonlinear temporal dependencies through sophisticated gating mechanisms[1]:
```
fₜ = σ(Wf·[hₜ₋₁, xₓ] + bf)    # Forget gate
iₜ = σ(Wi·[hₜ₋₁, xₓ] + bi)    # Input gate  
C̃ₜ = tanh(WC·[hₜ₋₁, xₓ] + bC) # Candidate values
Cₜ = fₜ·Cₜ₋₁ + iₜ·C̃ₜ        # Cell state update
```
- Architecture: Single layer with 64 hidden units
- Excels at learning long-range temporal dependencies
- Limitation: Cannot model spatial relationships between sensors

**GNN (Graph Neural Networks)**
Models spatial dependencies by treating traffic sensors as graph nodes[1]:
```
h(l+1)_v = σ(W(l) · AGGREGATE({h(l)_u : u ∈ N(v)}))
```
- Graph construction: Nodes represent sensors, edges encode spatial proximity
- Edge weights: `wᵢⱼ = exp(-d²ᵢⱼ/σ²)` for distances ≤ 2km[2]
- Architecture: Two layers with 64 units each
- Limitation: Weaker at capturing temporal evolution patterns

### Ensemble Fusion Strategies

The system implements five distinct weighting approaches[1]:

1. **Fixed Weights**: Predefined based on domain knowledge
2. **Inverse RMSE Weighting**: `wᵢ = (1/RMSEᵢ) / Σ(1/RMSEⱼ)`
3. **Rank-Based**: Performance-ordered weights (e.g., 0.5, 0.3, 0.2)
4. **Equal Weighting**: `wᵢ = 1/3` for all models
5. **Adaptive Weights**: Dynamic adjustment using `wᵢ = exp(f(xᵢ)) / Σexp(f(xⱼ))`

The adaptive approach achieves superior performance by contextually weighting models based on traffic conditions, leading to more accurate predictions across all evaluation metrics compared to any single model[1].

## Dataset & Preprocessing

### PEMS-BAY Dataset Specifications[1]
- **Coverage**: San Francisco Bay Area traffic sensors
- **Sensors**: 325 inductive loop detectors across major highways
- **Time Range**: January to May 2017 (5 months)
- **Sampling**: 5-minute intervals
- **Variables**: Traffic speed (miles per hour)
- **Missing Data**: Approximately 0.003% missing values
- **Network Structure**: 33 different road segments

### Data Processing Pipeline[1]
1. **Missing Value Handling**: Linear interpolation followed by forward/backward filling
2. **Normalization**: Min-Max scaling per sensor: `X_norm = (X - X_min)/(X_max - X_min)`
3. **Temporal Windowing**: Sliding windows of 12 input steps, 3 output steps with stride 1
4. **Graph Construction**: Distance-based adjacency matrix with exponential decay weighting
5. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Temporal: Hour of day, day of week, weekend indicators, holiday flags
   - Spatial: Node degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality

### Dimensionality Reduction[1]
- **Graph Coarsening**: Spectral clustering to create "super nodes"
- **PCA**: Applied spatially (node reduction) and temporally (sequence compression)
- **Sequence Downsampling**: Focus on significant temporal changes
